# Pymaceuticals Analysis 

The bar graph that was obtained from the programming showed that the drug, Capourmulin had the maximum number of mice allowed which was 230. The placebo drug had 181 mice on it, after removing all the duplicated mice, the total nubmer of mice was 248 with a gender split of 124 female and 125 male mice. 
The regression analsysis helped me understand how much the tumor volume changes with the weight of the mice which was an independent variable. The program got a r-squared of .70 which is a good number to predict from the model. Overall, 70% of the model explains the different variations. 
It found that the drugs, Capomulin and Ramicane were the best at reducing the size of the tumors.

For the project, I attended one study session on Thursday, July 20th at 1:00pm with Matthew Werth where I got help with multiple problems with my challenge. In addition, I used stack overflow to help me when I had problems getting the pandas and scipy to run. I also used the module directions to help me do the challenge
